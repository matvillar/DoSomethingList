# DoSomethingList - iOS

DoSomethingList is a user-friendly application where we can manage our daily tasks. It allows us to create an account and be able to add or delete tasks. Everything will get updated in Firebase.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of creating DoSomethingList was to improve my skills in Cloud DataBases, specifically in Firebase. This project also serves as a hands-on learning experience for me, as it allows me to improve my skills in app development and software engineering. By working on DoSomethingList, I aim to deepen my understanding of mobile app development concepts and create an application that is both educational and highly functional.

## Development Environment

### Tools Used

StockTrackerApp was developed using the following tools:

- **Xcode**: Xcode is the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for iOS app development. I used it for coding, debugging, and testing the app.

- **Git and GitHub**: Git was used for version control, and the project is hosted on GitHub to facilitate collaboration and code sharing.

- **Swift**: The primary programming language for iOS app development is Swift. I used Swift to write the code for DoSomethingList.

- **Firebase**: The primary programming language for iOS app development is Swift. I used Swift to write the code for DoSomethingList.

### Programming Language

The main programming language used in this project is Swift. Swift is a powerful and intuitive language specifically designed for developing iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications. It offers modern features and syntax that make it well-suited for mobile app development.

By using Swift, I was able to leverage the full potential of iOS development, including access to the iOS SDK, SwiftUI, UIKit framework, and various iOS-specific libraries and tools. This choice of programming language allowed me to create a responsive and efficient app that provides a smooth user experience.
